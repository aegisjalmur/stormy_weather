Been building this project with some basic api response output.. nothing special, just to get into the topic again.
used this video as a guideline, but made up my own code from the idea. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JqdjWB88Kk
Didn't use any ai, just my own hands and brain ;)

functionaliy > appearence, therefore very little css in it :P
might change a bit in future projects, but I'm much more into functinality

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
